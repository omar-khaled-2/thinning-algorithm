# Thinning Algorithm - Image Skeletonization

This repository contains code for a thinning algorithm used for image skeletonization. Skeletonization aims to extract the one-pixel thick centerline of a shape in a binary image.

## Dependencies:

* Sharp: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)
* readline: Built-in Node.js module

## How to Use:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
npm start
```

3. The script will prompt you for the input image file. Ensure the file exists in the same directory.

4. After processing, a new file named "output.jpeg" will be created containing the thinned image.

### Description:

* The `thinning` function implements a thinning algorithm to iteratively remove pixels from the foreground while preserving the overall shape.
* The `main` function reads an image, preprocesses it by converting to grayscale, resizing, and binarizing, then applies the thinning algorithm and saves the resulting skeleton as a new image.

###  Notes:

* This code implements a basic thinning algorithm. There are many other thinning algorithms with different properties.
* The `threshold` value in `main.js` controls the binarization process. You might need to adjust this value depending on your image data.

**Further Improvements:**

* Implement support for different image formats.
* Allow users to specify the output filename.
* Explore and integrate more advanced thinning algorithms.
