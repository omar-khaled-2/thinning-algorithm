# Thinning Algorithm

## Overview
This script applies a thinning algorithm to binary images. Thinning is a morphological operation that reduces the thickness of foreground objects while preserving their connectivity. The implemented algorithm iteratively removes pixels from the edges of foreground objects until no further changes occur.

## Requirements
- Node.js installed on your system

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have a binary image file as input. The image should be in grayscale format, where foreground objects are represented by white pixels (pixel value = 255) and background by black pixels (pixel value = 0).
2. Run the script using Node.js. You will be prompted to enter the path to the input image file.
3. The script processes the image using the thinning algorithm.
4. The resulting thinned image is saved as "output.jpeg" in the current directory.

## Example
```bash
npm start
```

## Notes
- The input image should be in PNG format.
- The output image is saved in JPEG format.


## Credits
- This script utilizes the Sharp library for image processing.
